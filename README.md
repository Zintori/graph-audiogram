graph-audiogram
===============

This is a sample custom view to build audiogram reports on Android. Audiogram graphs are unique because the y-axis scale is in reverse (positive to negative) and with pre-defined markers.

Audiogram graphs are important to people with hearing loss, as audiologists will perform tests to establish the level of hearing loss across different frequencies.

Currently, what you will need are simply the custom view and the data model class. I will add more features and make it more customisable. Please make feature requests if you have any.

There are many awesome projects on GitHub but I find that libraries for accessibility needs are very lacking, thus I decided to create this project.
